# Artificial-Neural-Network

Artificial Neural Network using PyTorch & Keras

Building the Artificial Neural Network Model by using the PyTorch & Keras libraries.

With the classification dataset "Indian Diabetes" and our main goal is to predict the whether the patient has diabetes or not.

Patient with diabetes is indicated as- 1

Patient with no diabetes is indicated as- 0

By experiment with differnt hyperparameters we got the accuracy 75.39% and also we can pushup the accuracy by experiment on hyperparameters.
